RPG2: co-operative 2-player storytelling

init - one player chosen at random starts the story off:
who is this?  - pixle needs a name and maybe title/role
- "roooooo", "king"
- "smeghead", "drifter"
- "punky", "murderer"
where are they? - place on an abstract generated backdrop
- "the kingdom of ick"
- "planet nerdulon-5"
- "glamor city"

player turn (first turn skips stuff in parens; got to init):
-(optionally mark previous turn 'awesome')
-(determine previous turn's action odds of success)
-(move, remove, )
- 
- move/add character/stamp
- motivation or internal monologue
- dialog with any nearby character
- action the character attempts
- optional: THE END (if enough 'awesome' points acquired)
- commit to story

stamps - abstract 8x8 shapes that can be put as landmarks:
- star
- heart
- dagger
- blood stain
- apple
- ball

dnd style storytelling - very abstract, maybe grid? no limits
very limited presentation - graph paper and pen caps. imagination!
