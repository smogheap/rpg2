It felt like time to change that.  I've also been hankering, for whatever reason, to do some old-fashioned storytelling.  The imagination paints scenes more beautifully than even the highest production values can manage.  At the same time, there's something wildly satisfying about using bottle caps and salt shakers to represent parties and landmarks.  Low-fidelity, abstract visuals meet vivid story possibilities.  The telling and authorship of the tale should be the actual game mechanic.  We consume so much more than we create now, and that can't be healthy.","theend":false},{"title":"Doubles Storytelling","scene":{"seed":23805,"color1":"#00340b","color2":"#4f2a20","stamps":[{"name":"","color":{"r":0.3003738372360698,"g":0.41986978120359775,"b":0.990053821421412},"shape":[72,125,51,113],"x":22,"y":3},{"idx":6,"x":31,"y":3},{"idx":6,"x":46,"y":23},{"name":"","color":{"r":0.877350839871823,"g":0.025665784493355992,"b":0.610802704510927},"shape":[102,41,102,49],"x":54,"y":23},{"idx":12,"x":38,"y":24},{"idx":12,"x":30,"y":24},{"idx":12,"x":22,"y":24},{"idx":6,"x":14,"y":23},{"name":"","color":{"r":0.9772412241297657,"g":0.6903373111685077,"b":0.5425423008088431},"shape":[59,13,72,23],"x":6,"y":23},{"idx":0,"x":54,"y":15},{"idx":6,"x":27,"y":49},{"name":"","color":{"r":0.9460901726631143,"g":0.26607571965520604,"b":0.7770329579608928},"shape":[22,36,24,58],"x":23,"y":52},{"name":"","color":{"r":0.0424398301724449,"g":0.9453675228709859,"b":0.9368776501696457},"shape":[71,34,12,111],"x":31,"y":51},{"idx":8,"x":27,"y":41}]},"plot":"So there we have it.
